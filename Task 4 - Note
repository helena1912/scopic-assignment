1. For Task 1, I use Cypress framework with Javascript  for writing and executing end-to-end tests. It also integrate with mochawesome to generate reports after eaching running. 

You can read the README.md file to understand how it works and install the necessary package.

2. For Task 2, I use Postman. I organize API requests into collections based on functionality and use pre-request script for setting up the state before request execution and Tests scripts for validating responses. I also prepare some scripts in Tests and verify the response status code and response body. I also store some test data for next request.
